                <p id="test">To most people, Hange appeared to be an energetic, freethinking researcher with a very
                    unique way of
                    conducting
                    themselves and their work through their rather observant and objective character. Hange explains
                    that when they
                    first joined the Survey Corps, their heart was filled with hatred; untill they kicked the head of a
                    3 meter
                    Titan and were shocked at how abnormally light it was. This drove Hange to forget most of the
                    resentment and
                    insecurity they held onto, and take on a new approach to Titan research. Hange also showed great
                    compassion for
                    the Titan test subjects, even crying when they were forced to put Bean in severe pain for an
                    experiment, and
                    having a complete meltdown when the Titans were killed.</p>
                <p>As the threat of the enemy became more severe, Hange less frequently showed their lighthearted
                    nature, often
                    remaining calm and serious. However, they still displayed great empathy toward others, including the
                    dead and
                    suffering. This was last seen when Hange attempted to console Mikasa Ackerman by explaining their
                    agony over the
                    constant loss of their comrades - hugging her in sorrow. Despite being a brave soldier, Hange
                    confided in Moblit
                    Berner that they felt terror in all of the Titan things that were unknown to them, but their
                    curiosity about the
                    Titans and concern toward Hange's dear ones appeared to be greater. As their responsibilities
                    continued to grow
                    with their position as Commander, Hange more frequently showed signs of severe anger, stress, and
                    exhaustion.
